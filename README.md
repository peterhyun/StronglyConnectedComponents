# StronglyConnectedComponents
This program is for finding strongly connected components given a graph by three matrix representation methods which are the adjacency 
matrix method, the adjacency list method, and the adjacency array method.
The graph input should be given as standard IO, and the first line contains n (1,2,3,...,n) in the rst line, and the (i+1)st line contains edges going
out of vertex i (the rst number in the line is the number of edges).
